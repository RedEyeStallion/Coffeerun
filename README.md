# Coffeerun

This program is an assignment from Big Nerd Ranch's "Front-End Web Development" by Chris Aquino and Todd Gandee.

Coffeerun is a fun shopping-cart style app that manages coffee orders for a food truck. Users are able to input orders and submit those orders to a database where they can later be deleted upon delivery.

This app utilizes:
*JQuery
*Ajax
*Twitter Bootstrap
*Promises
*Deferreds
